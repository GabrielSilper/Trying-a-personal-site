# Trying-a-personal-site

I decided today make a site showing a little about me, its a simple site and a form to practicing more what i have been learn in ProgramadorBR.

If my english is hard to read, sorry, i've been practicing and studying to be better and i'm a little rusty.

It's been a while since i took a course and i forgot a lot.
